# Security

## Data and privacy

- **Local-first:** Vantura stores all data in your browser (IndexedDB). Transaction and account data does not leave your device except to sync with the Up Bank API using a token you provide.
- **API token:** Your Up Bank Personal Access Token is encrypted with a key derived from your passphrase (PBKDF2-SHA256, 100,000 iterations; AES-GCM 256-bit). The passphrase is never stored. Only the encrypted token and derivation salt are stored locally.
- **No secrets in repo:** No API keys, tokens, or passphrases are committed to this repository. `.env` and `.env.*` are gitignored.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

- **Preferred:** [Open a private security advisory](https://github.com/ostafford/Vanture_v3/security/advisories/new) on GitHub.
- Alternatively, open a private issue or contact the maintainer directly if you have a secure channel.

Do not open a public issue for security-sensitive findings.
