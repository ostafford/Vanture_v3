/**
 * Weekly insights per 05_Calculation_logic 5.4 and 04_Core_Features 4.5.
 *
 * Term definitions (aligned with Up Bank app and product intent):
 *
 * - Money In: Real income only (salary, refunds, etc.). Excludes internal transfers
 *   (e.g. from a saver back to spending). Filter: amount > 0 AND transfer_account_id IS NULL.
 *
 * - Money Out: Spending only (purchases, charges). Excludes internal transfers out
 *   (e.g. to a saver). Filter: amount < 0 AND transfer_account_id IS NULL.
 *
 * - Savers: Net movement to/from any saver account (Loose Change, Investing, Bupa Insurance,
 *   Rego, etc.). Filter: transfer_account_id IN (accounts WHERE account_type = 'SAVER').
 *
 * - Charges: Count of spending transactions. Same rules as Money Out (negative, non-transfer).
 *   One charge per purchase (e.g. Coles, ALDI).
 *
 * - Payments made: Scheduled or manual payments to external parties (BPAY, PayID, bank transfer)
 *   where Up app shows Payment Method = Payment. Filter: transfer_type IS NOT NULL.
 *   Currently 0 because we do not set transfer_type from the API yet; reserved for future use.
 *
 * - Category chart: Spending by category (same as Money Out), no transfers. Same filter as
 *   Money Out, grouped by category_id.
