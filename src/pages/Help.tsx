          What is Vantura?

        <Card.Body>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Vantura is a desktop-first financial insights app that syncs with
            your Up Bank account. Your data is stored locally in your browser
            and never leaves your device. When you sync, transactions are
            downloaded to this device only—no cloud storage; we don&apos;t have
            servers that store your data.

        </Card.Header>
        <Card.Body>
          <p className="mb-2">
            During setup you create a passphrase (used to unlock the app each
            time), add your Up Bank Personal Access Token, and set your payday
            schedule. The token is validated and encrypted with your
            passphrase-derived key before being stored.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            To get an API token: in the Up Bank app go to Profile → Data sharing
            → Personal access tokens, create a new token, and paste it into
            Vantura during onboarding or in Settings when updating.

          Spendable balance
        </Card.Header>
        <Card.Body>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Spendable</strong> is your Available balance minus money
            reserved for upcoming charges before your next payday. Only charges
            due before the next payday are reserved; recurring charges (monthly,
            quarterly, yearly) are prorated so you see a fair &quot;safe to
            spend&quot; amount.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            You can set an optional low-balance alert: click the Spendable card
            on the Dashboard to set a dollar amount or a percentage of your pay.
            When Spendable drops below that threshold, the card turns red.

        </Card.Header>
        <Card.Body>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Trackers let you set a budget and track spending by category over a
            period. You choose a reset frequency: Weekly, Fortnightly, Monthly,
            or Payday. You can assign one or more categories to each tracker.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            The dashboard shows progress (how much of the budget is used), days
            left in the period, and transactions in the current period. PAYDAY
            trackers reset on your next payday and can warn you when you&apos;re
            over budget before payday.

        <Card.Body>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Savers reflect your Up Bank saver accounts. You can set a goal
            amount and optional target date. The dashboard shows current
            balance, goal progress, and monthly transfer if set. Goal-based
            savers help you see how much you need to put away to hit your target
            by the date.

        <Card.Body>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Upcoming charges are manual entries for bills and subscriptions you
            know are coming (e.g. rent, Netflix). You enter name, amount,
            frequency (weekly, fortnightly, monthly, etc.), and next charge
            date. Each charge can be marked &quot;Include in Spendable&quot;
            (default: yes), meaning it reduces your Spendable until that date.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Charges are grouped by &quot;Next pay&quot; (before your next
            payday) and &quot;Later&quot; so you can see what&apos;s due soon
            versus later.

            The Transactions page lists all synced transactions. You can filter
            by date range, category, amount range, and search text. Sort by
            date, amount, or merchant. Transactions are grouped by date.
            Round-ups are linked to their parent transaction when applicable.

            In Settings you can re-sync with Up Bank (to pull the latest
            transactions and category changes), update your API token (e.g. if
            it expired), change your payday schedule and pay amount, and clear
            all data (which deletes the database and returns you to onboarding).
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            You can also run the dashboard tour again from Settings to be
            reminded how the main areas work.
