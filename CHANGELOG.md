The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Mobile / portrait layout (≤768px):** Optimised for vertical/portrait screens. Sidebar becomes an overlay drawer (hamburger in navbar opens it); content is full width with vertical scroll only. Weekly Insights and Savers charts use vertical bar charts on narrow viewports. Transactions page: vertical card list and filters in a drawer (Filters button). Upcoming section: vertical cards on mobile. See `src/lib/constants.ts` (MOBILE_BREAKPOINT_PX), `src/hooks/useMediaQuery.ts`, `src/layout/Layout.tsx`, `src/pages/Transactions.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/InsightsSection.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/SaversSection.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/UpcomingSection.tsx`.
- **Quality gates:** `typecheck`, `format:check`, and `validate` scripts; CI runs format-check, lint, typecheck, tests, and `npm audit --audit-level=critical` before build.
- **Tests:** Vitest; tests for `lib/crypto` (encrypt/decrypt round-trip), `lib/format`, `lib/payday`, and `services/balance` (reserved amount).
- **Pre-commit:** Husky + lint-staged to run Prettier and ESLint on staged `src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}`.
- **SECURITY.md:** Data handling and vulnerability reporting.
- **CHANGELOG.md:** Keep a Changelog format; README links to it and documents updating Unreleased when adding features.
- **Help:** User guide at `/help` (What is Vantura, getting started, Spendable, Trackers, Savers, Upcoming, security). Help popover/link from onboarding and Settings.
- **Dashboard tour:** First-time product tour (driver.js) over balance cards, Savers, Trackers, Weekly insights, Upcoming, sidebar, Lock. Can be run again from Settings ("Show dashboard tour again").
- **Trackers period navigation (icons + tooltips):** Previous/Next use chevron icons with tooltips ("Previous period", "Next period") at all viewport widths; removes the previous 900px text/icon label swap. See `src/components/dashboard/TrackersSection.tsx`. Aligns with `docs/trackers-icons-tooltips-recommendation.md`.
- **Chart axis labels (D3 bar charts):** D3-based bar chart components for Weekly Insights and Savers with estimated axis label space for a compact left axis on desktop and readable labels on mobile (`src/components/charts/InsightsBarChart.tsx`, `src/components/charts/SaversBarChart.tsx`, `src/lib/chartLabelSpace.ts`).
- **Trackers badge color (schema v2):** Optional `badge_color` per tracker; migration in `src/db/schema.ts` adds the column for existing DBs. Trackers UI and `src/services/trackers.ts` read/write it; TrackersSection shows a coloured badge when set.
- **Weekly Insights category colours (global persistence):** Category bar colours chosen in the Weekly Insights chart now apply to that category in all weeks (past, current, and future). Modal helper text and toast ("Colour updated for all weeks.") clarify the behaviour. Uncategorised transactions use a stable colour key for consistency. Savers Edit goals modal: helper text "This bar colour applies to this saver." See `src/lib/chartColors.ts`, `src/components/dashboard/InsightsSection.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/SaversSection.tsx`.

### Changed

- **Sync state:** Centralised sync state in `syncStore` (`lastSyncCompletedAt`, syncing flag) used by Navbar, Dashboard, Settings, and Transactions for consistent "last synced" and sync-in-progress behaviour.
- **UI / styling:** Theme and accent colour options (Settings); layout/styling refinements (e.g. index.css, BalanceCard, StatCard, dashboard sections, Navbar, Sidebar).
- **Trackers:** Removed `TRACKER_COMPACT_NAV_*` constants from `src/lib/constants.ts`; period nav is now icon + tooltip at all widths.

## [0.0.1] - 2025-02-23

### Added

- **Onboarding & Sync (Phase 2):** 6-step onboarding wizard (welcome, passphrase creation, API token validation and encryption, payday schedule, initial sync, completion).
